# Python programming postgraduate course

This repository stores the python jupyter notebooks written for the postgraduate course Python Programming hosted by the University of Edinburgh. I completed this course at the end of 2019 during the first year of my PhD.

The course was very useful in teaching python from a syntax and academic perspective but also from a mathematical perspective. The skills gained were how to structure, style and write Python code that is reproducible, informative and of a professional standard.
